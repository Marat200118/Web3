# Vertical

Do not focus only on the horizontal axis. It might be necesary to change the layout when there is not enough vertical space.

Have a look at the screenshots, try to create the following:

- When there is less than 50em horizontal space, the navigation header is positioned on top.
- When there is less than 30em vertical space + more than 50em horizontal space, some adjustments are made, so the navigation takes up less space.
- When there is less than 30em vertical space + less than 50em horizontal space, the navigation is just positioneed on top. It doesn't make sense to have it on the side anymore.
