# Min and Max

## Part 1

Check the CSS code. First, note the use of the attribute place-items which is a shorthand property for aligning items in a grid or flexbox in both directions.

Also check the media queries. There is a query for a minimal width of 300, 500, 700 and 900. Each query sets a different text. However, the text “min-width: 900px” never appears. Even if the width is more than 900px.

Why is this? Solve this problem.

## Part 2

Rewrite the media queries using max-width. Show the corresponding value in the ::after section.

## Part 3

Rewrite the min-width mediaqueries again, this time using `em` values. You can round them to the nearest ten.
