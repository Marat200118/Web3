# Orientation

Copy / paste the previous exercise and remove the media queries. Write a new media query that checks the orientation of the page and shows “landscape” or “portrait”.

First, check the result with the Dev Tools in your browser. Resize the browser and the text will change depending on the screen ratio. Move your dev toolbar from the bottom to the side or vice versa. What do you notice?

EXTRA: try to launch the application to your actual smartphone (if you have an Android device)
