Starting with this exercise from previous year, we can introduce some new features and see how they behave.

- Introduce a type scale and fluid space values from <https://utopia.fyi/>
  - Experiment with different values. Are these values usable everywhere in your project?
  - Use your developer tools to see how the values change, sometimes this can be very subtile.
- Switch everything to logical properties. When the viewport gets large, switch the author of the article to the top left. Set the writing mode to vertical.
  - Do the logical properties work like expected? Explain.
- Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the result.
