# News

We are about to make a news website containing a lot of articles.

Let us focus on a micro layout for the articles themselves and then a macro layout for the whole page.

Pay attention to what you are changing at what size. Is it at micro or macro level?
The goal is to make container queries and media queries work together, not against each other.

There are 3 sources of articles (top headlines, sport and science)
At a small size everything is underneath each other, on a larger size the sport is positioned to the right of the top headlines.
