# Bookstore

We don't have to rely exclusively on resizing, we can also drag-and-drop items into other containers who have different sizes.

The whole drag-and-drop thing is already provided for you. (This is done in plain JS, but there are libraries that make this easier.)

Try to come up with a different layout based on the size of the container. The first one resembles books on a shelf, where you can only see their backs.
The second column is when a book lays open and you can read some content of it.
The last column resembles a book on a table, where you can see the cover.
